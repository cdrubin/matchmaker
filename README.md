NOTE!

I've found enough issues in this library to not use it. 
It remains here for historical purposes but I
would not recommend anyone expect it to work reliably as-is.

matchmaker
==========

PHP functions that help you validate structure of complex nested PHP arrays.

```php
$books = [
    [
        'type' => 'book',
        'title' => 'Geography book',
        'chapters' => [
            'eu' => ['title' => 'Europe', 'interesting' => true],
            'as' => ['title' => 'America', 'interesting' => false]
        ]
    ],
    [
        'type' => 'book',
        'title' => 'Foreign languages book',
        'chapters' => [
            'de' => ['title' => 'Deutsch']
        ]
    ]
];

$pattern = [
    '*' => [
        'type' => 'book',
        'title' => ':string contains(book)',
        'chapters' => [
            ':string length(2) {1,3}' => [
                'title' => ':string',
                'interesting?' => ':bool',
            ]
        ]
    ]
];

matchmaker\matches($books, $pattern); // true
```

It could be used to check scalar values, objects or arrays from different sources (JSON, XML, Post Data).

## Matching rules

Matching rules are strings that start with ':'. You can use multiple matchers joined with space.
Matcher could be any callable (name of function or closure). You can add your own rules or replace standard ones.

* **General**

 * empty
 * nonempty
 * required
 * in(a, b, ...)
 * mixed
 * any

* **Types**

 * array
 * bool
 * boolean
 * callable
 * double
 * float
 * int
 * integer
 * long
 * numeric
 * number
 * object
 * real
 * resource
 * scalar
 * string

* **Numbers**

 * gt(n)
 * gte(n)
 * lt(n)
 * lte(n)
 * negative
 * positive
 * between(a, b)

* **Strings**

 * alnum
 * alpha
 * cntrl
 * digit
 * graph
 * lower
 * print
 * punct
 * space
 * upper
 * xdigit
 * regexp(pattern)
 * email
 * url
 * ip
 * length(n)
 * min(n)
 * max(n)
 * contains(needle)
 * starts(s)
 * ends(s)
 * json
 * date

* **Arrays**

 * count(n)
 * keys(key1, key2, ...)

* **Objects**

 * instance(class)
 * property(name, value)
 * method(name, value)

More details you can find [here](https://github.com/ptrofimov/matchmaker/blob/master/src/rules.php)

## Quantifiers for keys

* ! - one key required (default)
* ? - optional key
* * - any count of keys
* {3} - strict count of keys
* {1,5} - range

For matchers (i.e. ':string') default quantifier is *

## Installation

* Install matchmaker via composer for your project:
```
composer require ptrofimov/matchmaker:*
```
